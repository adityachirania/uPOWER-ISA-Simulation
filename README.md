# uPOWER-ISA-Simulation
An Simulator that parses assembly level code of uPOWER instruction set, converts to object code and then simulates its execution

# Instructions that have been implemented in the assembler
All the instructions mentioned in the pdf have been implemented in the assembler. The assembler is a 2 pass assembler that maps all labels to their addresses in memory the first pass. In the second pass the instructions are converted to binary code.The memory contents and binary codes are passed to the simulator and the simulator executes them one by one.
